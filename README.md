# VS Code Extension: DeepSeek Chat in Your Editor

## TL;DR

Ever wished you could chat with DeepSeek without leaving your code? Now you can! This extension brings DeepSeek‚Äôs magic directly into VS Code. Ask questions, get answers, and look productive while secretly just chatting with an AI.

## What It Does

- **Prompt & Answer**: Type a prompt, get a response. That‚Äôs it. No fluff, no frills.
- **Stay in Flow**: No more tab-switching to ask DeepSeek for help. Laziness wins again.
- **Local Power**: Runs DeepSeek locally using **Ollama**. No API keys, no fuss.
